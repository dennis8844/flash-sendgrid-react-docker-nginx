# Styles

Creative Tim, like their friends from [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com/?ref=creativetim) used JSS syntax to style (restyle) the material ui components.

A useful link about [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs?ref=creativetim) is this one here.

We've decided to use the `makeStyles` function from Material-UI to override some of thier styles. This is a React HOOK functions, which means that it can only be called from another React HOOK or a simple function. Read more about it [here](https://material-ui.com/styles/api/#makestyles-styles-options-hook)

All of the restyled components can be found in `src/_material-toolkit-components` which ahs been restructured a bit form Creative Times original architecture to keep the components and the stories seperate for easier understanding.


If you go to any of our components you will see that somewhere at the beginning of the file we import `makeStyles` from `material-ui`, then we import from `src/_material-toolkit-components/_assets/jss/*` the corresponding style for that component and after these imports, we use the `makeStyles` function alongside our styles to compile them to jss from javascript objects. Again, the directory of the assets has also been changed to keep them in a seperate directory from the stories.

For a better way of understanding this variables, please take a look inside the `src/_material-toolkit-components/_assets/jss/material-dashboard-react`. You will see that all of the styles have a unique name that corresponds with the component name. You will also see that we've removed the styling for the views that were initially in the toolkit.
