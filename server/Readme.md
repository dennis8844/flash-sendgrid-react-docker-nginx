# Welcome to the flask app

Typical boilerplate that is set up via Docker

## setup

Add these to your .env file before building.. there is one in this zip, but in case there isn't you can add your own easily

```bash
DEBUG=True
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_APP=server.create_app.py
SENDGRID_API_KEY='<YOUR KEY>'
```
